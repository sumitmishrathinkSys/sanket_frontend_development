<!-- LINUX -->

REPL -> Read Evaluate Print Loop

Note : - For any linux command you can actually check the usage and different input flags 
it expects by running the command followed by --help

<!-- To Know in which folder you are there is a command pwd -->
  <!-- pwd -->
<!-- pwd : this represnt what is the current directory we are correctly at  -->
  <!-- pwd --help  working in linux not in mac-->
   <!-- Run  man pwd  in mac -->     man pwd
    <!-- ls is going to print whole directory content  -->
     <!-- ls : you can print the content of the current directory we are in. All the fields and current sub directories will be printed.  -->

     <!-- cd -> to move inside a folder -->
    
    cd : this can help you to move into a folder (cd folder_name)  and move out of a folder (cd ..).
    cd.. : if you want to jump one folder back from the current directory
    cd../..  : if you want to make two jumps back from the current directory
    cd ~ : From any directory this will help you to come back to the home directory
    cd directory1/directory2/ : we can actually move into internal subdirectories directly by seperating them with a forward slash / .

    Note : 

    ~ -> this tilda refers to the home directory Ex: /Users/sumitmishra .
    / -> this slash leads you to root directory
    home directory is sub directory of the root directory.
    Relative path : It describes location of a file/folder w.r.t current folder. Ex:- cd /Users/sumitmishra/habit_clone .
    Absolute path : It describes location of a file/folder w.r.t home directory or root  directory. Ex:- cd /Users/sumitmishra/habit_clone .
   
    cd / : / is the root directory which / is the parent of all directory and beyond this no directory exist.
    cd ~ : ~ is the home directory which is the parent of all user directory.
    cat : this command helps us to read the content of the file .

    When you give absolute path of a file or folder that means you will give the whole path of that file or folder, whereas in relative path you do jumps w.r.t to the current folder.

    clear : clear the working space by actually moving you to top of the current shell.

    ls : With the help of ls you can list of all of the files/folder in the current shell
  ls : you can print the content of the current directory we are in. All the fields and current sub directories will be printed. 
  ls -l : lists down more details about file such as owner permission, date etc.
  ls -lh : works like ls -l but also give size of the file.
  ls -a : lists down all the files including hidden files.

  Create files and folders

  mkdir <foldername> : this helps us to create a new folder 
  touch <filename> : this helps us to create a new file .
  cat <filename> : prints the whole contents of a file.
  rm <filename> : this helps us to remove a file.
  rmdir <subfoldername> : this helps us to delete a subfolder (but subfolder should be empty if subfolder is not empty then it will not allow us to delete that subfolder).
  touch <subfoldername/filename.txt> : this helps us to create a file directly from outside a subfolder.
  rm -r <foldername> : this helps us to delete a folder and all its subdirectories (even subfolder contains any sub0subfolder or subfiles).
        the -r flag enables rm to recursively delete all subfolders and the content of all subfolder and then delete the folder.

  rm -rf <foldername> : this helps us to delete a folder and all its subdirectories even without given any warning so we should avoid to use it because if make a mistake and do (rm -rf / ) then / is redirectting to root directory which can lead to delate all folders and also operating system of the system so we shouldn't use it

  
  To get the last some of any file without opening it directly we can use tail.

  tail <filename> : this helps us to print some last lines of the file.
  tail -n 3 <filename> : this helps us to print last 3 lines of the file.
  tail -n 5 new_file.txt :  this helps us to print last 5 lines of the file. 
  so we can enter number (3,5, or any number) of line we want to print.
  tail -f <filename> : this helps us to print the last line of the file and if you don't want to exit.

  Why tail is important? Why you shouldn't do cat instead of tail?
  Suppose if you are looking a log file, a log file can have thousands or lakh numbers of line, so if you do cat , it will start printing lakhs number of lines in your terminal. 
  And if actually you are debugging then it doesn't make much sense to print lakhs number of lines in your terminal so just print the last logs.


  Apart from the tail there is also head to print the starting lines of the terminal.
  
  head <filename> : this helps us to print some start lines of the file.
  head -n 3 <filename> : this helps us to print start 3 lines of the file.
  head -n 5 new_file.txt :  this helps us to print start 5 lines of the file. 
  so we can enter number (3,5, or any number) of line we want to print.
  head -f <filename> : this helps us to print the start line of the file and if you don't want to exit.

  To print some thing on the terminal just like a print command in any language
  echo Sumit(Any word) : this helps us to print the string on the terminal.

  if you want to dump the result of echo command into any file and don't want to print it then.
  echo "Sanket Singh" > dump.txt   - Now the result of echo "Sanket Singh" is dumped into dump.txt file

  if you want to print the content of dump.txt then
  cat dump.txt 

  so this is a cool dumping technique that you can use if any point of time you want to dump bunch of logs inside a file and you don't want to just open it 


  Piping 

  To perform searching on the terminal like whether it is file or logs , you can perform searching by using ( | grep) command. 
  This | pipe helps us to take the output of one command and pass it as input of the next command.
  Even if you know just the starting words or letter (substring) you can use that to search.
  So it's going to take your less time in searching that are definitely very useful.

  ls | grep searchingwords  : It will helps list down all the list of directories then | grip will help to search the word that we have mentioned from the output of ls (list)
  ls | grep python : this will actually pass the output of ls an input to grep, grep does a substring search of python on the output of ls.
  
  ps aux is actually going to list all of the process that are actually running in your system.
  ps aux | grep searchingwords : It will help us to search from the output of list of process that are actually running in your system and whatever searchingwords you will enter it will filter out from the list and print it on the terminal.

  Sometimes what happens you wrote a command and you want to dump the output of that command into some file
  For example : you actually runs a command and there are bunch of logs that are coming and you want to dump that logs into a particular file.
  Because it becomes very hard to read here or suppose you want to send this file to someone that this is the result of my command so what you can do is 

  ls > output_result.txt : Dump  the  output of ls command into output_result.txt file.
  cat output_result.txt  :  Now you can see the output of ls command that is dumped into output_result.txt file.
  ls > new.txt : whatever the result of ls will be dumped into new.txt, nothing will printed on the console.
  if new.txt has already some content then that will be replaced.

  pwd >  output_result.txt : Dump  the  output of pwd command into output_result.txt file.
  cat output_result.txt  :  Now you can see the output of pwd command that is dumped 

  ls >> output_result.txt : It will append the output of ls into the  output_result.txt file so the previous content will append with the current ouptut of ls. (so whatever the content of output_result.txt is also present and after that the result of ls is also appended )
  so nothing is getting replaced you are just appending the your data in a file.
  ls >> new.txt : whatever the result of ls will be dumped into new.txt, nothing will printed on the console.
  if new.txt has already some content then the new content will be appended.

  To run any file from the command line 
  For Ex: if you want to run a C++ file then ,

  g++ filename.cpp --std=c++14 -o run : This command will compile the file and create an executable file 
  
  ./run : This command will run the executable file.

   g++ filename.cpp --std=c++14 -o run && ./run : This command will compile the file and create an executable file and then run executable file.


  <command1> &&  <command2> : This is a logical AND operator. It will execute command2 only if command one has no error.

  Now suppose if you want to copy a file and paste into another file
  
  cp file1 file2 : copies the content of file1 to file2
  cp old_file.txt new_file.txt  : This command will copy the old_file.txt and paste it into new_file.txt

  cp test.txt folder_name1/new_file.txt :  This command will copy the test.txt and paste it into folder_name/new_file.txt .
  cp folder1/test.txt folder2/new_file.txt : This command will copy the content from folder1/test.txt and paste  it into folder2/new_file.txt.


  Now suppose if you want to move a file and paste into another file and also rename the file you can use mv command
  cp file1 file2 : moves(cut paste) the content of file1 to a new position as file2. This can also helps us to rename a file.

  mv old_file.txt new_file.txt  : This command will rename the old_file.txt to new_file.txt
  movement can be done in the same file also or we can use it for rename any file.

  mv test.txt folder_name1/new_file.txt :  This command will move the test.txt to folder_name/new_file.txt .
  mv folder1/test.txt folder2/new_file.txt : This command will move the content from folder1/test.txt to folder2/new_file.txt.

  To create a zip file using command 
  tar -cf archive.zip new_file.txt new_test_file.txt second.txt  : This command will create a zip file with the name of archive.zip (you can name anything instead of archive ) and also you can add multiple files (as many as you want to compress) into it.
  
  tar command is actually start adding it to a zip and -cf command is actually enables to get all of the files. But it doesn't compress anything.
  But if you want to compress the files and then bind them into the zip then you can use -zcf command .
  tar -zcf archive.zip new_file.txt new_test_file.txt second.txt  : This command will  create a zip file with the name of archive.zip (you can name anything instead of archive ) and  also you can add multiple files (as many as you want to compress) into it and also compress the all files.

  If you want to see the content of archive files , it is not going to expand or extract the content then you can use below command.
  tar -tf archive.zip : This command will show you the content of archive.zip file.
  OR 
  tar -xvzf archive.zip : This command will show you the content of archive.zip file.

  If you want to extract the content of any zip file then  you can use below command.
  tar -xf archive.zip -C extract : This command will extract the content of archive.zip file. (But you need to make sure in whatever folder you want to extract the zip file it should be present else you need to create that folder then you can extract the zip file into it)
