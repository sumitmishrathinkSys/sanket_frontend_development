vim <filename>  - this will create a new file (if it doesn't exist) and then open it in vim editor in the normal mode.
In normal mode we can't do changes to the file but we can read it and navigate it. You can also use vi <filename> to do the same thing.

Now after opening vim if you want to start making changes you need to first of all make it change the mode from normal to insert mode.
To go in the insert mode we can press i . if you want to come back to the normal mode then press esc .

esc + :q -> if you want to exit a file we can do this.
esc + :q! -> if file has some changes and we want to exit without saving changes to the file.
esc + :wq -> if file has some changes and we want to save it and then exit.

In vim mode if you want to navigate to any line (up or down)  or left or right then you can use arrow key to navigate.

Apart from the arrow (up, down, left and right) keys we have some other ways to navigate to any line in normal mode.
l : You can move the cursor right in normal mode
h : You can move the cursor left in normal mode
j : You can move the cursor down in normal mode
k : You can move the cursor up in normal mode

You can use normal left right up down arrow keys as well to navigate.

dd : In normal mode, if you press dd then it will delete the line whatever line is your cursor at, it will delete that whole line.
dw : In normal mode, if you press dw then it will delete the word whatever word is your cursor at
gg : In normal mode, if you press gg you will redirect to left top of the vim editor.
G : In normal mode, if you press G you will redirect to bottom line of the vim editor.
